# Weatherly 
Weatherly is a weather checker app for your domestic and global reference needs. Name any state or country and the precise temperature and general weather condition will be listed. The app version is a buddy in your pocket and, depending on the temperature, will change background and inform if the location's weather is sunny, windy, or cloudy.

# How It's Made
Tech used: React, React.js, CSS, Heroku
I am proud of myself for getting my first app ever on Heroku. Previous beginning attempts at Heroku from other projects led to failure upon deployment. The react element allows there to be interaction with the search bar and for the background to change. A weather API called Open Weather Map was utilized as well for data accuracy and updates. 

# Optimizations
Versions 1.0 and 1.1 consisted of debugging efforts to get the app to work. Version 1.2 has a more polished look with complete functionality. Future iterations include switching back and forth to Fahrenheit, adding more background options based on weather conditions, including space for advertisers, and creating a homepage for the app. Debugging also includes double checking for spelling accuracy when making commands. 

# Lessons Learned
You don't need to be right the first time. You just need to be right once. I get such a rush making a new project that I forget to stop and smell the roses in realizing my potential. Everyday is a new day to become better than yesterday to move the needle forward by at least 1%. No matter how dark life gets, there is beauty and lught on the inside. Somewhere deep in your code is a beautiful human with a soul, heart, and mind who is loyal, dedicated, and kind. Never let these character traits fall as you become more successful.
